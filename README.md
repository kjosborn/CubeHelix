CubeHelix PixInsight Plugin
===========================

This script is a Javascript plugin for PixInsight.  It is an adaptation of the cubehelix pseudo colour mapping scheme developed by Dave Green of the University of Cambridge.  The colour scheme was developed specifically for astronomical use and is described in his paper, "Green, D. A., 2011, A colour scheme for the display of astronomical intensity images, Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India, 39, 289"
